- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lavaa444.
- Iâ€™m a college student interested in various fields in computer science.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C++, HTML and a couple other popular languages. I'm learning by working on a couple independent projects.
- I'm not interested in collaboration at the moment, but that may change. Feel free to check in later.

Feel free to look at what I'm working on right now. Again, I'm still learning, so my code can be a mess sometimes!
It's all a part of the process. Have a good day.
